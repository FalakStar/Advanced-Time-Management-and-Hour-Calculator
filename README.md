# 🚀 Advanced Time Management and Hour Calculator

## 📌 Overview

**Advanced Time Management and Hour Calculator** is a console-based application developed in C++ and Java that accurately calculates working hours between a start and end time.  

The system computes total working duration, handles overnight shifts, and automatically calculates overtime when working hours exceed standard limits.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of time calculation logic and structured programming concepts.

## ✨ Features

- ⏰ Accurate working hour calculation  
- 🌙 Automatic next-day shift handling  
- 📊 Overtime calculation (if work exceeds 8 hours)  
- 🧮 Hour and minute conversion from total minutes  
- 💻 Simple and user-friendly console interface  
- ⚡ Fast and efficient execution  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 💻 C++ (Standard Library)
- ☕ Java (Core Java – Scanner Class)

## ▶️ How It Works

1. User enters **Start Time** (Hour and Minute).
2. User enters **End Time** (Hour and Minute).
3. The system:
   - Converts both times into total minutes
   - Calculates the difference
   - Converts total minutes back into hours and minutes
   - Detects overnight shifts automatically
   - Calculates overtime if total hours exceed 8

## 🧪 Example

**Input:**
```

Start Time: 09 00
End Time: 18 30

```

**Output:**
```

Total Working Time: 9 hours and 30 minutes
Overtime: 1 hour

```
